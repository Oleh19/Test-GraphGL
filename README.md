I did not use useMemo, React.memo, etc. because there was no need for them in this application's scale.
Regarding the tasks:
- 2 сторінки (Home and Favorites)
- Hover effects have been added to the buttons.
- “Favorite” button redirect to favorite page.
- In the "Banner" section, everything is static except for the link to the block with products.
- The cards retrieve data from the API and have only one active button, which is "Add to Favorites".
- Pagination has been added.
- “Clean all” and 'delete from favorites' delete all and delete individual items, respectively.
